## Introduction
West Lake Elementary is experiencing challenges with data management for its 225 students due to errors and inconsistencies in student profiles. This project addresses these issues by implementing look-up tables to enhance data accuracy and consistency.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to resolve data management issues by introducing look-up tables. These tables will ensure accurate data entry, improve decision-making for administrators, and streamline data manipulation for teachers.

## Project Summary

### Objectives

###	•	Achieve 100% error-free data for student and teacher profiles.
###	•	Increase data consistency across the warehouse by 60%.
###	•	Enable data analysis for future business opportunities by March 2024.
###	•	Implement look-up tables by July 2023.

## Scope

### The look-up tables will allow easy insertion, deletion, and modification of data. The project includes:

###	•	Look-up table specifications.
###	•	JAVA API utilization.
###	•	Defined attributes and values (e.g., student name, grade).
###	•	Upgraded UI for administrators, teachers, and families.
